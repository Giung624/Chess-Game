# Chess-Game
A Chess Game in Java
----------
As a part of my project in CS 242 at UIUC, I'm writing a Chess Game (and will probably execute the GUI in Swing).
Emphasis is on code-style and maintainability.
Feel free to go through the source files till I finish the GUI implementation.

Update 9/11: Most of the logic is complete. Check out the cool CONSOLE colors I used!

Update 9/19: The Static GUI is ready!
